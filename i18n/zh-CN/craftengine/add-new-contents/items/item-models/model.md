# üìê Model

The model consists of two parts: path and tints. Tints are optional. You can view all available tint types in the link below.

{% content-ref url="model/tint" %}
[tint](model/tint)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% hint style="success" %}
In this configuration, we create a model for custom leaves. However, the default leaves in the vanilla game do not have color, so we need to configure a tint to color them.
{% endhint %}
