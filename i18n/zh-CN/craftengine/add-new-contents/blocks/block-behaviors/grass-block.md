# ðŸŒ¿ Grass Block

[grass-block](grass-block "mention") allows you to perform bonemeal on them to grow grass and flowers. Don't forget to add tag `minecraft:dirt` to your blocks otherwise grass won't survive on them. Check [#tags](../../block-settings#tags "mention") if you don't know how to add tags to your block.

```yaml
blocks:
  default:grass_block:
    behavior:
      type: grass_block
      feature: minecraft:grass_bonemeal
```
