# ðŸ“” Worldgen Datapack Tutorial

## Important Things to Know

{% hint style="danger" %}
Since Minecraft do not permit the dynamic modification of the block registry, the plugin pre-registers all necessary real states in advance. You can query the actual block states corresponding to a block by using [#get-block-internal-id](../commands#get-block-internal-id "mention").

Minecraft only recognizes block names that follow the pattern similar to `craftengine:note_block_x`. This applies even when you are using other plugins, such as MythicMobs' block placement skills. The reason for this is that CraftEngine employs a dynamic binding scheme, which means the block IDs within the plugin do not align with the actual block IDs on serverside.
