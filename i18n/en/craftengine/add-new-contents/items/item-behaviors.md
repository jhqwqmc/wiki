# 🕹️ Item Behaviors

Unlike [item-settings](item-settings "mention"), [item-behaviors](item-behaviors "mention") is more about how something interacts—like the rules or logic behind those interactions. It checks each interaction rule **one by one, in order**, and stops at the **first valid one** it finds. Once that happens, any remaining behaviors **won’t even be checked**.
