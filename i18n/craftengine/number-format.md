# ðŸ”¢ Number Format

### constant

Provide a fixed numerical value.

```yaml
type: constant
value: 1
```

{% hint style="success" %}
In most cases, you can use the following abbreviated notation.

```yaml
count:
  type: constant
  value: 1
```

->

```yaml
count: 1
```
{% endhint %}

### uniform

Provide a random number within the given range.

```yaml
type: uniform
min: 1
max: 3
```

{% hint style="success" %}
In most cases, you can use the following abbreviated notation.

```yaml
count:
  type: uniform
  min: 1
  max: 3
```

->

```yaml
count: 1~3
```

Both `min` and `max` also support the nested use of `number provider`.&#x20;

```yaml
count:
  type: uniform
  min:
    type: uniform
    min: 2
    max: 7
  max: "<papi:skilllevel_farming>*5~<papi:skilllevel_farming>*10"
```
{% endhint %}
